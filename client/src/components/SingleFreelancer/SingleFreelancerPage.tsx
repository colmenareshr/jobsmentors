            I am a person who is passionate about remote work and the area of
            â€‹â€‹technology. ðŸŽ¯ I am currently looking for a job in this sector and
            be able to contribute my knowledge and experience, both as a full
            stack web developer, and in the DevOps culture and thus face the
            challenges that arise in the company. I seek to grow in knowledge,
            experience and teamwork, in a stable work environment in the area of
            â€‹â€‹technology. ðŸ‘‰ I have been working as a freelancer since 2016.
            Most of my work experience has been as a web designer with WordPress
            on teleworking platforms. I have also taken on projects individually
            that come by recommendation. Each and every one has been a great
            challenge, learning and enjoyable and communicative work. Currently
            I am still preparing to enter a work environment as a Full Stack and
            DevOps web developer in various online training courses at different
            institutions that offer technology training. ðŸ™Œ
