# PointPillars Deploy

PointPillars deploy covers the TAO Deploy actions for an exported 3D object detection model. Use the `pointpillars` model skill for training, checkpoint evaluation, quantization, distillation, pruning, export, or non-TensorRT inference where those actions exist. Use this deploy workflow after export when the input artifact is an ONNX model and the desired output is a TensorRT engine or TensorRT-backed predictions.

Supported actions: `gen_trt_engine`, `evaluate`, `inference`.

## Quick Start

### Generate TensorRT Engine

```bash
docker run --gpus all --rm --shm-size=16g \
  -v /path/to/specs:/specs \
  -v /path/to/export:/models \
  -v /path/to/results:/results \
  nvcr.io/nvidia/tao/tao-toolkit:6.26.3-deploy \
  pointpillars gen_trt_engine -e /specs/pointpillars_deploy_gen_trt_engine.yaml
```

### Evaluate TensorRT Engine

```bash
docker run --gpus all --rm --shm-size=16g \
  -v /path/to/specs:/specs \
  -v /path/to/eval:/data \
  -v /path/to/results:/results \
  nvcr.io/nvidia/tao/tao-toolkit:6.26.3-deploy \
  pointpillars evaluate -e /specs/pointpillars_deploy_evaluate.yaml
```

### TensorRT Inference

```bash
docker run --gpus all --rm --shm-size=16g \
  -v /path/to/specs:/specs \
  -v /path/to/inference:/data \
  -v /path/to/results:/results \
  nvcr.io/nvidia/tao/tao-toolkit:6.26.3-deploy \
  pointpillars inference -e /specs/pointpillars_deploy_inference.yaml
```

Deploy action metadata is in `tao-deploy-pointpillars.skill_info.yaml`. Deploy spec templates live in this references folder:

- `spec_template_deploy_gen_trt_engine.yaml`
- `spec_template_deploy_evaluate.yaml`
- `spec_template_deploy_inference.yaml`

## Deploy Workflow

1. Train and export with the `pointpillars` skill.
2. Keep the exported ONNX artifact and any sidecar files together in the mounted model directory.
3. Build the TensorRT engine with this workflow.
4. Run TensorRT `evaluate` or `inference` from the engine artifact produced by `gen_trt_engine`.

Direct TAO Launcher spelling is `tao deploy pointpillars gen_trt_engine`, `tao deploy pointpillars evaluate`, `tao deploy pointpillars inference`.

## Required Inputs

| Action | Required artifact or data | Spec key |
|---|---|---|
| `gen_trt_engine` | Exported ONNX model | `gen_trt_engine.onnx_file` |
| `gen_trt_engine` | Output engine path | `gen_trt_engine.save_engine` |
| `evaluate` | TensorRT engine | `evaluate.trt_engine` |
| `evaluate` | Point cloud data path | `dataset.data_path` |
| `evaluate` | Data info path | `dataset.data_info_path` |
| `inference` | TensorRT engine | `inference.trt_engine` |
| `inference` | Point cloud data path | `dataset.data_path` |
| `inference` | Data info path | `dataset.data_info_path` |

For direct Docker runs, mount input folders at the same paths used in the spec. For chained jobs, map exported ONNX artifacts into `gen_trt_engine.onnx_file` and map the engine artifact into `evaluate.trt_engine` or `inference.trt_engine` where those actions are available.

`gen_trt_engine.save_engine` must be a writable file path in the spec, but it should not be declared as a file input or pre-created by the skill runner. TAO Deploy creates the engine file at that path. If the runner creates the path as a directory first, engine generation fails or writes to the wrong location.

## Spec Overrides

Carry structural model and dataset settings forward from the train/export spec. The deploy defaults are templates, not a substitute for the model-specific values used to produce the ONNX file.

Recommended starting overrides:

```python
{
    'gen_trt_engine.data_type': 'fp16',
    'gen_trt_engine.batch_size': 1,
    'evaluate.batch_size': 1,
    'inference.batch_size': 1,
}
```

Model-specific notes:

- PointPillars deploy uses `gen_trt_engine.save_engine` for the engine output path, not `gen_trt_engine.trt_engine`.
- PointPillars TensorRT engine generation supports FP32 and FP16; INT8 is rejected by the deploy script.
- Keep class names, point cloud range, voxel settings, and post-processing config aligned with the exported model.
- `dataset.data_info_path` is the folder produced by the parent `dataset_convert` action. It must be mounted into the deploy container at the exact path used in the spec.
- For smoke validation with a barely trained checkpoint, raise `model.post_processing.score_thresh` if TensorRT evaluate or inference becomes CPU-bound. The deploy CPU NMS path filters by score before NMS but does not honor `nms_pre_max_size`, so low thresholds such as `0.1` can leave hundreds of thousands of candidate boxes and look like a hang.

## Job Chain Mapping

| Action | Spec field | Parent or output |
|---|---|---|
| `gen_trt_engine` | `gen_trt_engine.onnx_file` | export job ONNX |
| `gen_trt_engine` | `gen_trt_engine.save_engine` | new engine output path |
| `gen_trt_engine` INT8 | calibration image/cache fields | calibration dataset and new cache output |
| `evaluate` | `evaluate.trt_engine` | engine job output |
| `inference` | `inference.trt_engine` | engine job output |

## Outputs

| Action | Output |
|---|---|
| `gen_trt_engine` | TensorRT engine at `gen_trt_engine.save_engine` |
| `evaluate` | 3D detection metrics under `evaluate.results_dir` |
| `inference` | 3D detection prediction files under `inference.results_dir` |

## Known Pitfalls

**Engine profile mismatch:** Runtime batch size for evaluate or inference must fit within the TensorRT min/opt/max profile used during `gen_trt_engine`.

**Template class or shape mismatch:** Copy class count, input resolution, backbone, and post-processing settings from train/export before running TAO Deploy.

**INT8 calibration missing:** INT8 builds need an extracted calibration image directory, a writable cache path, and enough images for `cal_batch_size * cal_batches`.

**Mounted paths do not exist:** TAO Deploy checks local paths inside the container. Make sure every path in the spec has a matching Docker mount or job artifact mapping.

**CPU NMS trap on smoke models:** If deploy `evaluate` or `inference` starts but emits no progress after Hydra startup, inspect the checkpoint quality and `model.post_processing.score_thresh`. A one-epoch smoke model can produce many high-scoring boxes; use a stricter threshold for validation-only runs and document the threshold in the report.
