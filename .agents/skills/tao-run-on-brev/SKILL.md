# Brev

NVIDIA Brev provides on-demand GPU instances across multiple cloud providers. Instances come pre-loaded with NVIDIA drivers, CUDA, Docker, and NVIDIA Container Toolkit.

Brev is instance-based (not job-based). You create an instance, run commands on it via `brev exec`, and delete it when done. The TAO SDK's BrevHandler wraps this into the standard job interface.

## Preflight

This skill needs the `brev` CLI and an active login. Check before proceeding:

```bash
# 1. brev CLI installed
command -v brev >/dev/null 2>&1 || {
  echo "MISSING: brev CLI not installed. Install:"
  echo "  https://docs.nvidia.com/brev/"
  exit 1
}

# 2. brev command reference available.
brev --help >/dev/null || {
  echo "MISSING: brev CLI help unavailable; verify the brev installation."
  exit 1
}

# 3. brev login active — always token-login first when running headless.
#    Plain `brev ls` will hit an interactive auth prompt (read: EOF on stdin)
#    even when BREV_API_TOKEN is set, so refresh the session up front.
if [ -n "$BREV_API_TOKEN" ]; then
  brev login --token "$BREV_API_TOKEN" >/dev/null 2>&1 || {
    echo "MISSING: brev token login failed. Verify BREV_API_TOKEN."
    exit 1
  }
fi
# Retry once after a forced re-login: cached creds occasionally desync and the
# first `brev ls` returns auth EOF until the session is rebuilt.
brev ls >/dev/null 2>&1 || {
  [ -n "$BREV_API_TOKEN" ] && brev login --token "$BREV_API_TOKEN" >/dev/null 2>&1
  brev ls >/dev/null 2>&1 || {
    echo "MISSING: not logged in to brev. Run:"
    echo "  brev login                                    # interactive (opens browser)"
    echo "  # or export BREV_API_TOKEN in your shell before launching (then 'brev login --token \$BREV_API_TOKEN')"
    exit 1
  }
}
```

If any non-pip step fails, the agent prompts the user to authorize the fix via Bash, then re-runs the preflight before continuing. The TAO SDK is **not** required for Brev — `brev exec docker run …` is sufficient. Reach for the SDK only if you want Job handles, S3 I/O wrapping via `script_runner`, or state persistence; `nvidia-tao-sdk` is on public PyPI, install missing SDK requirements automatically from the pinned Brev extra in `versions.yaml`: `python -m pip install "$("${TAO_SKILL_BANK_PATH:?}/scripts/resolve_versions_key.py" wheels.tao_sdk_brev)"`. **When going the SDK route, read `tao-skill-bank:tao-run-platform` for the `BrevSDK` kwarg reference, `build_entrypoint`, and `ActionWorkflow` patterns.**

## Authentication

Two options:

1. **Automated (recommended)**: Get an API token from the Brev console settings page. Set `BREV_API_TOKEN` as an environment variable (e.g., `export BREV_API_TOKEN=...` in your shell). The handler auto-authenticates via `brev login --token` on first use.

2. **Manual**: Run `brev login` (opens browser). Tokens expire hourly — the handler refreshes automatically.

S3 credentials (ACCESS_KEY, SECRET_KEY) are needed separately for data transfer.

### Headless / non-interactive

In a CI shell, container, or agent session with no controlling TTY, **always
run `brev login --token "$BREV_API_TOKEN"` before any other `brev` call** —
even when the token is exported. Otherwise the CLI prompts on stdin and
returns an `EOF` auth error on commands like `brev ls`, `brev create`, or
`brev exec`. Re-run the token login if a call returns auth-EOF; a single
refresh is usually enough.

## Launch Preflight

Before generating scripts or submitting jobs:

1. Verify `BREV_API_TOKEN` is set.
2. Verify the `brev` CLI is installed and can list instances, for example
   `brev ls --json`. If needed, authenticate with `brev login --token`.
3. For `s3://` datasets/results, verify `ACCESS_KEY` and `SECRET_KEY` are set
   and the exact paths are readable with `aws s3 ls`.
4. Do not accept local `/path` inputs for Brev unless the user has proven those
   paths exist on the target Brev instance or are mounted into it.
5. Verify model-specific credentials such as `HF_TOKEN` before launch.

## Instance Lifecycle

The agent controls instance lifecycle:

- **Reuse**: Pass `instance_id` in `backend_details` to run multiple jobs on the same instance. Efficient for multi-step workflows.
- **Ephemeral**: Omit `instance_id` — the handler creates a new instance per job. Clean but slower (instance boot ~2-5 min).

### Creating an instance — placement info

For accounts with more than one cloud credential or workspace group, plain
`brev create` rejects the call with a placement error. Pass the account-specific
IDs explicitly:

```bash
brev create my-instance \
  --gpu L40S:1 \
  --cloud-cred-id <cloudCredId> \
  --workspace-group-id <workspaceGroupId>
```

Discover the values once and export them in your shell before launching:

```bash
brev ls --json | jq -r '.workspaces[0].workspaceGroupId'   # default group
brev orgs --json | jq -r '.[0].cloudCredentials[].id'      # cloud credential
```

When using the SDK, pass them through `backend_details`:

```python
BrevSDK().create_job(
    ...,
    backend_details={
        "cloud_cred_id": "<cloudCredId>",
        "workspace_group_id": "<workspaceGroupId>",
    },
)
```

## Multi-GPU and multi-node

**Multi-node is not supported on Brev.** Brev is instance-based — one job runs on one instance, with no cross-instance coordination.

Multi-GPU **on a single instance** is supported (instances available with up to 8× H100 / A100 / L40S). `gpu_count` maps to the GPU count on the instance; `torchrun --nproc-per-node=N` or PyTorch DDP work within the instance.

## GPU Types

Available via `brev search`:
- L40S, A100 80GB, H100 (availability varies by provider)
- Use `--gpu-name` to filter, `--min-vram` for memory requirements

## Storage

No shared NFS/Lustre. All data flows through S3 via the script_runner's fsspec integration. Instance-local disk at `~/` persists across stop/start but not across delete/create.

## Docker on Brev

VM Mode instances have Docker pre-installed. For TAO container images:

```bash
# NGC auth (one-time per instance)
brev exec <instance> -- docker login nvcr.io -u '$oauthtoken' -p <NGC_KEY>

# Run a TAO training job
brev exec <instance> -- docker run --gpus all --rm \
  -v ~/data:/data \
  nvcr.io/nvidia/tao/tao-toolkit:6.26.3-pyt \
  visual_changenet train -e /data/spec.yaml
```

### Wait for instance readiness before the first `brev exec`

A freshly created instance reports `RUNNING` long before sshd, hostname
resolution, and the user shell are ready. The first `brev exec` against an
unsettled instance fails with `hostname not resolvable`,
`Connection refused`, or a silent timeout. Always poll until a trivial exec
succeeds before issuing real work:

```bash
# Wait up to 5 minutes for shell readiness — covers the SSH bring-up window.
for i in $(seq 1 60); do
  brev exec <instance> -- true >/dev/null 2>&1 && break
  sleep 5
done
brev exec <instance> -- true >/dev/null 2>&1 || {
  echo "instance <instance> never became exec-ready"; exit 1;
}
```

### `brev exec` timeout for cold-start workloads

`brev exec` inherits no default timeout, but anything that wraps it (the SDK
handler, CI step wrappers, `timeout` shell builtins) must allow time for both
the SSH bring-up window and the container pull on a fresh instance. Use
**≥ 600 s (10 min)** for the first exec on a new instance; the previous
60–120 s default truncates remote startup and surfaces as a spurious
`exec failed` even though the remote command is still progressing.

## Cleanup

```bash
brev delete <instance>      # plain delete — no flags
```

The CLI does not accept `--yes` / `-y`; passing it errors with
`unknown flag: --yes`. `brev delete <instance>` is already non-interactive on
recent CLIs, so no confirmation flag is needed.

## Error Patterns

**brev CLI not found**: Install from https://docs.nvidia.com/brev/.

**`brev ls` returns auth EOF even with `BREV_API_TOKEN` set**: Headless shell
has no stdin for the interactive auth prompt. Run
`brev login --token "$BREV_API_TOKEN"` first, then retry. If the failure
persists across a single retry, the token itself is stale — mint a fresh one.

**Token expired**: Handler auto-refreshes via `brev login --token`. If
persistent, run `brev login` manually.

**`brev create` rejected with placement error (`cloudCredId` /
`workspaceGroupId` required)**: Multi-credential or multi-workspace accounts
must pass `--cloud-cred-id` and/or `--workspace-group-id`. See
*Creating an instance — placement info* above.

**`brev exec` fails with `hostname not resolvable` or `Connection refused`
right after create**: Instance reports `RUNNING` before sshd is up. Use the
readiness-wait loop in *Wait for instance readiness before the first `brev
exec`* before issuing the real command.

**SDK exec timeout / `exec failed` on a fresh instance**: The SDK's
`brev exec` wrapper timed out before remote startup finished. Raise the
timeout to ≥ 600 s for cold-start runs (see *`brev exec` timeout for
cold-start workloads*).

**`brev delete --yes`: `unknown flag: --yes`**: The CLI has no confirmation
flag. Use plain `brev delete <instance>`.

**Instance stuck in provisioning**: Some GPU types have limited availability. Try a different `--gpu-name` or provider.

**Docker pull fails on nvcr.io**: NGC_KEY not set or expired. Run `docker login nvcr.io` on the instance.
