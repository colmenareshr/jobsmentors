# Research Priorities Reference

Use this reference only when the parent `SKILL.md` points here for the current task. If this file conflicts with current `SKILL.md`, `skill_info.yaml`, schemas, or platform/model skills, the current authoritative source wins.

## Contents

- Priority ladder
  - Priority 1 — Model card usage example *(always fetch)*
  - Priority 2 — HF repo example script for the task
  - Priority 3 — Author finetune script / notebook linked from the model card
  - Priority 4 — HF task documentation *(always fetch as cross-check)*
  - Priority 5 — Paper methodology *(only if hyperparameters still unclear)*
  - Priority 6 — GitHub search fallback *(last resort)*
- Extract and record
- Resolving source conflicts
- Stop criteria


The live-fetch ladder for Step 3 (Research). Walk priorities in order, stop once
you have enough to write the code. The ordering is deliberate: API-fresh sources
come first (they track current `transformers`); method-specific sources fill in
task-specific details.

---

## Priority ladder

### Priority 1 — Model card usage example *(always fetch)*

- Source: `https://huggingface.co/<model_id>/raw/main/README.md`
- Extract: the card's literal `from transformers import X, Y` block. This is the
  authoritative API surface for this model — the exact `AutoModel`/`AutoProcessor`
  class names, `trust_remote_code`, `torch_dtype`, `_attn_implementation`,
  `quantization_config` requirements.

### Priority 2 — HF repo example script for the task

- Source (CV / standard tasks):
  `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huggingface/transformers/main/examples/pytorch/<task>/run_<task>.py`
  where `<task>` is one of `image-classification`, `object-detection`,
  `semantic-segmentation`, `instance-segmentation`, `contrastive-image-text`.
- Extract: current-API training loop, argument parsing, collator choice,
  transforms, `compute_metrics`. CI-tested against current `transformers` —
  freshest API patterns available.
- If no matching HF repo script exists for your task (e.g., VLM finetune, depth
  estimation), skip to Priority 3.

### Priority 3 — Author finetune script / notebook linked from the model card

- For `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/blob/<ref>/<path>`, rewrite to
  `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<owner>/<repo>/<ref>/<path>` and fetch it
  with the available web or source-control tool.
  Notebooks (`.ipynb`) are JSON — parse and extract code cells.
- Extract: method-specific recipe the HF repo script doesn't cover — custom
  collator, LoRA target modules, loss-masking scheme, learning rate / warmup /
  weight decay, dataset-specific preprocessing.
- Likely older API than Priority 2. If conflicts: Priority 2 for API calls,
  Priority 3 for method details.

### Priority 4 — HF task documentation *(always fetch as cross-check)*

- Source:
  `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huggingface/transformers/main/docs/source/en/tasks/<task>.md`
  (snake_case — `image_classification`, `object_detection`, `semantic_segmentation`,
  `monocular_depth_estimation`, `image_text_to_text`). The rendered page at
  `huggingface.co/docs/transformers/tasks/<task>` works too but raw markdown is
  cleaner to parse.
- Extract: conceptual explanation of the task, gotchas (e.g.
  `remove_unused_columns=False`), augmentation guidance.
- Lower priority than repo scripts because it often *refers to* them; use it for
  *why*, use the repo script for *how*.

### Priority 5 — Paper methodology *(only if hyperparameters still unclear)*

- Source: `https://huggingface.co/papers/<arxiv_id>` (links datasets, models,
  citations); full text at `https://arxiv.org/abs/<arxiv_id>`.
- Extract: reported learning rate, batch size, training budget, augmentation
  recipe.

### Priority 6 — GitHub search fallback *(last resort)*

Only if no card example, no HF repo script, no author link, no paper exists.

```
Search the web or GitHub for "site:github.com huggingface <model_type> fine-tune train.py"
```

then fetch the top result's raw URL. Quality varies; cross-check anything
you extract.

## Extract and record

From what you fetched, record in `meta/recipe.md` (and as a comment block at the
top of `train.py`):

- `AutoModel` / processor / image-processor classes
- Collator class and its constructor args
- Preprocessing transforms (train + eval, separately)
- `compute_metrics` implementation
- Model loading kwargs (`torch_dtype`, `attn_implementation`,
  `trust_remote_code`, `id2label`, `ignore_mismatched_sizes`,
  `quantization_config`)
- Training hyperparameter hints (LR, batch size, epochs, scheduler, weight decay)
- Each source URL you actually used — also into `config.yaml` under
  `research_sources:`.

If a section has no live finding, fall back to the matching scaffold reference
(`references/cv-scripts.md` or `references/vlm-scripts.md`) — but log
"fallback to scaffold — no live source for <section>" in `config.yaml` under
`notes:`.

---

## Resolving source conflicts

- **API calls** (imports, class names, argument shapes): prefer higher priority
  (model card > HF repo script > author script > docs > paper). Newer sources
  track the installed `transformers` version.
- **Method details** (collator logic, LoRA targets, loss masking, augmentation):
  prefer the author script over the HF repo script — the author knows the
  model's quirks. If only the HF repo script covers the task, use it.
- Note any discrepancy in a comment next to the affected code with the source
  URL.

---

## Stop criteria

Stop fetching when you have, for the detected task:

| Component | Source priority |
|---|---|
| `AutoModel` / processor class | Priority 1 |
| Train + eval transforms | Priority 2 or 3 |
| Collator | Priority 2 or 3 |
| `compute_metrics` | Priority 2 or 3 or 4 |
| Hyperparameter hints | model card body, Priority 3, or Priority 5 |

If any row is missing after the ladder, fall back to the scaffold reference
(`cv-scripts.md` / `vlm-scripts.md`) and log the gap.
