# PROGRESS.md Tracking Reference

Use this reference only when the parent `SKILL.md` points here for the current task. If this file conflicts with current `SKILL.md`, `skill_info.yaml`, schemas, or platform/model skills, the current authoritative source wins.

## Contents

- When to update PROGRESS.md
- PROGRESS.md Template
- Entry format conventions
- Minimal helper for updating PROGRESS.md
- Minimum content per phase


The skill maintains `PROGRESS.md` in `output_dir/` throughout the run. It is the living journal
of what was done, what was attempted, and what broke — visible to the user in real time.

**Why:** if the pipeline halts (OOM, network, container crash), the user can read PROGRESS.md
and understand exactly where we stopped and what to fix. No more "it silently failed three hours
ago."

---

## When to update PROGRESS.md

- **At Phase 0**: initialize the file
- **At the start of each phase**: append a header with phase name and timestamp
- **After each step**: append a one-line entry with status (`✅ done` / `⚠️ warning` / `❌ failed`)
- **When a bug is hit and fixed**: log the symptom, root cause, and fix — future readers of
  PROGRESS.md should see the thinking, not just the outcome
- **When a test fails**: log which test, the failure mode, and the fix
- **At Phase 10**: append a summary line

Think of it as a commit-log for the pipeline run.

---

## PROGRESS.md Template

The skill writes this at the start of Phase 0:

```markdown
# Generation & Validation Progress

**Project:** hft-{{SHORT_NAME}}
**Model:** {{MODEL_ID}}
**Dataset:** {{DATASET}}
**Started:** {{TIMESTAMP}}

| Milestone | Wall time | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Pipeline start | 0:00 | |
| Stage 1 complete (Discover) | — | |
| Stage 2 complete (Data) | — | |
| Stage 3 complete (Script) | — | |
| Stage 4 complete (Train) | — | training only |
| Stage 5 complete (Deliver) | — | |
| **Total** | **—** | generation + training |

This file is the running log of the tao-finetune-huggingface-model skill's work on this project.
Every phase appends a section. Bugs hit during generation are logged here — future readers
will see the debugging trail, not just the final scripts.

```

---

## Entry format conventions

**Single-line entries** (90% of cases):
```
- 2026-04-17 14:32:01 ✅ <what happened>
- 2026-04-17 14:32:18 ⚠️ <warning — training continued>
- 2026-04-17 14:32:59 ❌ <failure — stopped>
```

**Bug entries** (when something broke and you fixed it): use a sub-block:
```
- 2026-04-17 14:35:12 ❌ VLM training crashed at step 4
  - Symptom: `AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'shape'` in Idefics3.get_image_features
  - Root cause: `collate_vlm` falls back to a Python list for `pixel_values` when `torch.stack` fails
                 because Idefics3 produces variable `num_images` per sample for high-res images
  - Fix: rewrote collator to use `processor(text=list, images=list, padding=True)` at batch time,
         letting the processor handle image padding via `pixel_attention_mask`
  - Test added: `tests/test_collator.py::test_variable_num_images` — catches this regression
- 2026-04-17 14:37:30 ✅ VLM training resumed, reached step 4 without error
```

The bug sub-block documents the detective work so a reader (you in a week, the user, a different
agent) understands *why* the fix is what it is.

## Minimal helper for updating PROGRESS.md

Add this tiny helper so the skill can append entries without boilerplate:

```python
from datetime import datetime
from pathlib import Path
import time

_PIPELINE_START = time.monotonic()

def log_progress(msg: str, status: str = "✅", project_root: str = "."):
    """Append a dated line with elapsed wall time to PROGRESS.md."""
    elapsed = time.monotonic() - _PIPELINE_START
    h, m, s = int(elapsed // 3600), int((elapsed % 3600) // 60), int(elapsed % 60)
    wall = f"{h}:{m:02d}:{s:02d}"
    line = f"- {datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')} [{wall}] {status} {msg}\n"
    Path(project_root, "PROGRESS.md").open("a").write(line)

def log_milestone(name: str, project_root: str = "."):
    """Update the timing table for a named milestone."""
    elapsed = time.monotonic() - _PIPELINE_START
    h, m, s = int(elapsed // 3600), int((elapsed % 3600) // 60), int(elapsed % 60)
    wall = f"{h}:{m:02d}:{s:02d}"
    p = Path(project_root, "PROGRESS.md")
    text = p.read_text()
    text = text.replace(f"| {name} | — |", f"| {name} | {wall} |", 1)
    p.write_text(text)

# Usage:
log_progress("Training started — 3 epochs, 96 steps")          # → [0:02:14] ✅ Training started...
log_progress("HF Hub Xet hang — set HF_HUB_DISABLE_XET=1", status="⚠️")
log_milestone("Stage 4 complete (Train)")                       # fills timing table
```

The skill itself (not the generated scripts) is responsible for writing PROGRESS.md during
generation. Generated scripts can optionally append runtime events (training started, checkpoint
saved, etc.) so the log stays continuous across skill → wheel → training → report.

## Minimum content per phase

| Phase | Required entries |
|-------|------------------|
| 0 | model detected, task type, auto_model class |
| 1 | Docker, nvidia-container, disk, HF token, GPU, NGC image |
| 2 | container pulled, CUDA verified |
| 3 | dataset source, schema check, final count |
| 4 | scripts generated, syntax check, README written |
| 4.5 | tests generated, test results (all pass required) |
| 5 | wheel built, `hft-train --help` works |
| 6 | baseline eval (if not skipped), training complete, final loss |
| 7 | LoRA merge (VLM), or "skipped (CV)" |
| 8 | eval metrics |
| 9 | inference samples |
| 10 | report generated, summary line |

Missing entries mean "phase didn't happen" — useful as a read-only audit trail.
