# Core Rules — tao-finetune-huggingface-model

Use this reference only when the parent `SKILL.md` points here for the current task. If this file conflicts with current `SKILL.md`, `skill_info.yaml`, schemas, or platform/model skills, the current authoritative source wins.

## Contents

- Your knowledge of HF libraries is outdated

The non-negotiable behaviors the agent must follow throughout the
six-step workflow. SKILL.md summarises these and points here for the
full text.

## Your knowledge of HF libraries is outdated

You do not know current APIs for `transformers`, `trl`, `datasets`, `peft`, or
`accelerate`. Your internal knowledge WILL produce wrong imports, wrong trainer
arguments, wrong collator constructors, and hallucinated config fields. Before
writing any ML code, fetch the live sources listed in
`research-priorities.md` (sibling reference). Never generate training code
from memory alone.

---

## Mistakes you WILL make without research

- **HALLUCINATED IMPORTS** — modules renamed or removed. Read one current
  example script first.
- **WRONG TRAINER ARGUMENTS** — args that don't exist in the installed
  `transformers`/`trl`. Fetch the docs for `TrainingArguments` / `SFTConfig`.
- **WRONG DATASET FORMAT** — assuming columns. Stream 20 rows, print columns
  *before* writing the collator.
- **BATCH FAILURES** — launching multiple runs before verifying one. Smoke-test
  (`--max_steps 1`) on real data before the full run.
- **SILENT DATASET SUBSTITUTION** — requested dataset fails, you quietly switch.
  Stop. Tell the user. Ask.
- **SCOPE-CHANGING FIXES** — on OOM you switch SFT→LoRA, shrink `max_length`,
  disable monitoring. Don't. Fix with the minimal change that preserves the
  request.
- **LOST MODELS** — local disk can be cleared. `push_to_hub=True` always unless
  user explicitly says `False`.
- **HIDDEN LOSS** — `tqdm` bars hide loss. In `TrainingArguments`:
  `disable_tqdm=True`, `logging_strategy="steps"`, `logging_first_step=True`,
  `logging_steps=10`.
- **NO AUGMENTATION (CV)** — `AutoImageProcessor` only resizes+normalizes.
  Without `RandomResizedCrop` + `RandomHorizontalFlip` you can drop ~30-40 points
  on small datasets. Always fetch training transforms from the HF task doc or
  author's script — not memory.

---

## Never without user approval

- Change `model_id`, `dataset_id`, or `training_method`.
- Change task type mid-run (e.g. full → LoRA, classification → detection).
- Skip the smoke test or preflight check.
- Disable monitoring to "fix" an error.

---

## Error recovery — minimal change, same approach

- **OOM**: halve `per_device_train_batch_size`, double
  `gradient_accumulation_steps` (effective batch unchanged), enable
  `gradient_checkpointing=True`. Still OOM → ask user for bigger GPU.
- **NaN loss**: reduce LR 10×, set `max_grad_norm=1.0`.
- **Flat loss**: inspect label masking and LR. Usually a collator bug.
- **Same error 3× in a row**: stop, summarize, ask. Do not loop.
- **Import/API error**: refetch the relevant doc page — the API moved.

---

## Dataset format by task

Verify columns BEFORE writing the collator:

- `image-classification` — `image` + `label` (or `labels`)
- `object-detection` — `image` + `objects` with `bbox` + `category` (or `label`)
- `semantic-segmentation` — `image` + `segmentation` (or `label`, or `mask`)
- `depth-estimation` — `image` + `depth_map`
- `image-text-to-text` (VLM SFT) — `image` + `messages` (conversation), or
  `image` + `text` / `question` + `answer`

Mismatch + rename fixes it → do it in `prepare_data.py`. Restructuring needed →
stop and ask.

## Hardware sizing (bf16)

| Model size | GPU |
|---|---|
| ≤3B | 24 GB (A10, L4, T4-medium) |
| 7-13B | 80 GB (A100-80, H100) |
| 30B+ | multi-GPU (2-4× 80 GB) or LoRA on 1× 80 GB |
| 70B+ | 8× 80 GB or LoRA |

Rule of thumb: bf16 weights ≈ 2 B/param; optimizer states add ≈ 3-4× weights for
full finetune, ~0 for LoRA. If full won't fit and user didn't ask for LoRA, ask
before switching.
