# Cross-Cutting Rules — Execution Platform, Environment Isolation, Debugging

These rules apply across every phase of the TAO-HF integration workflow.

---

## Submodule Override Strategy (full detail)

The user clones the four TAO repos (`tao-core`, `tao-pytorch`, `tao-deploy`, `tao-dataservices`) independently into one working directory:

```
working-directory/
├── tao-core/             ← independently cloned — modifications go HERE
├── tao-pytorch/
│   └── tao-core/        ← submodule at original commit (stale — DO NOT use)
├── tao-deploy/
│   └── tao-core/        ← submodule at original commit (stale — DO NOT use)
└── tao-dataservices/
    ├── tao-core/        ← submodule at original commit
    └── tao-pytorch/     ← submodule at original commit
```

The nested `tao-core/` submodules point to the **original unmodified commit**; modifications only exist in the top-level `tao-core/`. **Always install from the top-level `tao-core/`, never from `<repo>/tao-core/`** — the nested submodule silently ignores all modifications (model configs, backbone mappings, etc.). In CI, Jenkinsfiles run `pip install tao-core/` (the submodule); the local override is:

1. **Mount the working directory** into the container: `-v $(pwd):/workspace`.
2. **pip install order:** `pip install /workspace/tao-core` FIRST, before tao-pytorch or tao-deploy, so modified config schemas are used instead of the stale submodule.
3. **PYTHONPATH:** top-level tao-core first, e.g. `-e PYTHONPATH=/workspace/tao-core:/workspace/tao-pytorch`.

## Cross-Phase Data Flow (full chain)

```
train → export → gen_trt_engine → inference / evaluate

train produces:           <results_dir>/train/<model_name>_model_latest.pth
export.checkpoint reads:  ${results_dir}/train/<model_name>_model_latest.pth
export produces:          <results_dir>/export/<model_name>.onnx
gen_trt_engine reads:     ${export.results_dir}/<model_name>.onnx
gen_trt_engine produces:  <results_dir>/trt/<model_name>.engine
inference reads:          inference.trt_engine = <engine_path>
evaluate reads:           evaluate.trt_engine = <engine_path>
```

## Execution platform

This skill executes every test, smoke run, and end-to-end validation inside a
locally prepared TAO Toolkit container (`tao-pytorch-base:latest`,
`tao-deploy-base:latest`, optionally `tao-dataservices-base:latest` — all
prepared in Phase 0). The platform skills own the *how* of running those
containers; this skill only specifies *what* to run inside them.

| Concern | Authoritative skill |
|---|---|
| GPU host runtime — NVIDIA driver 580, CUDA Toolkit 13.0, NVIDIA Container Toolkit 1.19.0 | [`tao-skill-bank:tao-setup-nvidia-gpu-host`](../../../platform/tao-setup-nvidia-gpu-host/SKILL.md) |
| `docker run` flags, NGC auth, `--gpus`, mounts, env passthrough, `--ipc=host`/`--shm-size`, container inspection, common error modes | [`tao-skill-bank:tao-run-on-docker`](../../../platform/tao-run-on-docker/SKILL.md) |
| Local Docker daemon preflight + per-job invocation | [`tao-skill-bank:tao-run-on-local-docker`](../../../platform/tao-run-on-local-docker/SKILL.md) |

**Default platform:** `local-docker`. This workflow requires bind-mounting
your local clones of `tao-core`, `tao-pytorch`, `tao-deploy`, and
`tao-dataservices` into the container at `/workspace`, then installing the
modified source via `pip install /workspace/tao-core` and `setup.py develop`.
That layout only makes sense against a Docker daemon you control. The Local
Only Rule is the corollary: no remote registry pushes, no remote job
submissions.

**GPU runtime preflight:** Phase 0 delegates the driver / CUDA / NCT checks
to the `tao-setup-nvidia-gpu-host` skill rather than duplicating them here. NGC
`docker login`, image pulls, and the published-image preparation step remain
in Phase 0 — those are the only TAO-Toolkit-specific bits.

**Docker run conventions:** every `docker run` invocation in Phases 3 / 4 /
6 follows the canonical flag set from `skills/platform/tao-run-on-docker/SKILL.md` (`--gpus
all`, `-v` bind mounts, `-e VAR` passthrough, `--shm-size=16G` for
DataLoader-heavy pytest, `--rm` for one-shots). The phase reference files
only specify the *workflow-specific* additions (`-w /workspace/<repo>`,
`PYTHONPATH=/workspace/tao-core:/workspace/<repo>`, the inner
`pip install /workspace/tao-core && python setup.py develop && pytest ...`
shell). If anything about the generic conventions changes, change it in the
docker platform skill — do not fork them inside this skill.

---

## Environment Isolation Strategy

All Python work runs **inside Docker containers** — no host venvs, no
`pip install`s into host Python. The same `tao-pytorch-base:latest` image
that Phases 3/4/6 use is also used for Phase 1's HF inspection, so the host
needs only Docker (provided by `tao-setup-nvidia-gpu-host`) and never needs
`python3-pip` / `python3-venv` / a particular Python version.

- **Context A — HF model inspection (Phase 1):** launch a long-lived
  `tao-pytorch-base:latest` container named `tao-hf-inspect`, bind-mount a
  host scratch dir at `/workspace`, and run each probe step via `docker
  exec`. A `python:3.12-slim` fallback is documented for environments where
  Phase 0 hasn't been run yet. Full commands in `phase-1-inspection.md`.
- **Context B — Incremental smoke tests (Phase 3/4):** run inside the
  prepared TAO Toolkit container (`docker run ... tao-pytorch-base:latest`)
  with the local source bind-mounted and installed via `pip install
  /workspace/tao-core && python setup.py develop`.
- **Context C — Temporary files:** scratch lives under the host bind-mount
  (e.g. `./.phase1`) so files end up host-user-owned (`--user $(id -u):$(id -g)`).
  Remove the scratch dir after the phase that created it, or keep it
  between runs to skip model redownloads.

Rules:

1. `pip install` — NEVER into the host/system Python. Always inside a
   container.
2. Host-level system packages (`docker`, `git`, kernel headers, NVIDIA
   Container Toolkit) are owned by the `tao-setup-nvidia-gpu-host` skill, which
   handles the distro-specific package manager (`apt-get` on Debian/Ubuntu
   and derivatives, `dnf` / `yum` on Fedora/RHEL/Rocky/Alma, `zypper` on
   openSUSE/SLES, manual instructions for other distros). This skill never
   issues `apt`/`dnf`/`zypper` commands directly — it only invokes
   `tao-setup-nvidia-gpu-host --check-only` and surfaces the error.
3. **Container UID convention — depends on the workload:**
   - Phase 1 inspection (Context A) — runs `python -c "..."` against
     pre-installed wheels in `tao-pytorch-base:latest`. **Pass
     `--user $(id -u):$(id -g)`**; HF cache + the `tao_hf_test.onnx`
     scratch file end up host-user-owned. The fallback path on
     `python:3.12-slim` does pip-install-at-startup, so it also sets
     `HOME=/workspace` + `PIP_USER=1` to route the install into a
     bind-mounted user-site instead of the root-owned system
     `site-packages`.
   - Phase 3 / 4 / 6 (Context B) — every smoke test, L0 test, and the
     end-to-end pipeline run `pip install /workspace/tao-core && python
     setup.py develop` against the container's **system** site-packages
     (root-owned). These invocations therefore run **as root** (no
     `--user`) and accept the trade-off that `*.egg-info/`, `build/`,
     `.pytest_cache/`, `dist/`, and `__pycache__/` left in
     `/workspace/tao-*` end up `root:root`. `sudo rm -rf` them or leave
     them between iterations — none of them is a source artifact.
4. Remove the long-lived inspection container (`docker rm -f
   tao-hf-inspect`) at the end of Phase 1.

## Module pitfalls (tao-pytorch vs tao-deploy)

- tao-pytorch and tao-deploy have **separate** `hydra_runner` and `monitor_status` implementations. Use the deploy versions in deploy scripts.
- The `ExperimentConfig` is imported from `nvidia_tao_core` in both repos — same schema, same field paths.

## Debugging Playbook

When something fails, consult this before trying random fixes:

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `ModuleNotFoundError` | Missing `__init__.py` or wrong PYTHONPATH | Add `__init__.py` to every package dir; check PYTHONPATH in docker command |
| `KeyError` in `BACKBONE_REGISTRY` | Backbone not registered or not imported | Add import to `backbone_v2/__init__.py`; verify `@BACKBONE_REGISTRY.register()` |
| Shape mismatch in forward pass | `head.in_channels` doesn't match backbone output dim | Check `model_params_mapping.py`; print backbone output shape |
| NaN loss after first epoch | LR too high, or wrong data normalization | Reduce LR by 10×; verify `augmentation.mean/std` matches model expectations |
| ONNX export fails | Unsupported op or dynamic control flow | Identify failing op; try `opset_version=17`; rewrite the op if needed |
| TRT engine build fails | ONNX graph has unsupported TRT ops | Run `trtexec --onnx=model.onnx` to identify failing layer; may need plugin |
| TRT accuracy << PyTorch | Preprocessing mismatch or precision loss | Compare `augmentation.mean/std` across specs; try FP32 engine first |
| OOM during training | Batch size too large or activation memory | Reduce `dataset.batch_size`; enable activation checkpointing; use FP16 |
| DDP hangs | Unused parameters in forward | `strategy='ddp_find_unused_parameters_true'` |
| Checkpoint load fails (missing keys) | State dict key mismatch | `strict=False` in `load_state_dict()`; check key mapping |
| `results_dir` files not created | Path doesn't exist or wrong permissions | `os.makedirs(results_dir, exist_ok=True)` |
| Config changes not taking effect | Stale submodule copy of tao-core | Verify `-v $(pwd):/workspace`; `pip install /workspace/tao-core` runs first |
