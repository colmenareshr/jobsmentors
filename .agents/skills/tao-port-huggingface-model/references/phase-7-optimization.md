### Step 26 — Diagnose What Needs Improvement

Run the end-to-end pipeline (Step 22) with real data (not just dry-run) and measure:

1. **Accuracy**: Compare against the HF model's reported metrics. If TAO accuracy is significantly lower:
   - Check data augmentation — are mean/std correct for this model?
   - Check learning rate — HF models often use different LR than TAO defaults
   - Check if backbone weights loaded correctly — print `missing_keys` and `unexpected_keys` from `load_state_dict()`
   - Try longer training (more epochs) with the HF-recommended schedule

2. **TRT vs Native accuracy gap**: If TRT accuracy is worse than native PyTorch:
   - Try FP32 engine first — if FP32 matches, the issue is precision loss in FP16
   - Compare preprocessing: ensure `augmentation.mean/std` and `preprocess_mode` match exactly
   - Run inference on the same images and compare output tensors numerically

3. **Training speed**: If training is too slow:
   - Profile with `torch.profiler` to find bottleneck
   - Check data loading: increase `workers`, enable `pin_memory=True`
   - Check if model is too large for GPU: reduce `batch_size` or enable gradient checkpointing

4. **Inference latency**: If TRT engine is too slow:
   - Profile with `trtexec --onnx=model.onnx --fp16 --verbose`
   - Check if dynamic batch is causing inefficiency — try fixed batch size
   - Check workspace size — increase if layers are falling back to slower algorithms

### Step 27 — Hyperparameter Tuning

Adjust training hyperparameters to improve accuracy:

```bash
# Try different learning rates
<model_name> train -e spec.yaml train.optim.lr=0.0001 train.num_epochs=50

# Try different optimizers
<model_name> train -e spec.yaml train.optim.optim=sgd train.optim.lr=0.01 train.optim.momentum=0.9

# Try different LR schedules
<model_name> train -e spec.yaml train.optim.policy=cosine train.optim.warmup_epochs=5

# Try different augmentations
<model_name> train -e spec.yaml dataset.augmentation.random_flip.enable=True \
  dataset.augmentation.random_color.enable=True \
  dataset.augmentation.random_erase.enable=True
```

**EMA (Exponential Moving Average)** — often improves accuracy:
```yaml
train:
  enable_ema: True
  ema_decay: 0.998     # Typical range: 0.99-0.9999
```

**Backbone freezing** — useful for small datasets:
```yaml
model:
  backbone:
    freeze_backbone: True     # Freeze all backbone layers
    freeze_norm: True         # Freeze batch norm statistics
# Only head is trainable → faster convergence, less overfitting
```

### Step 28 — Quantization (INT8)

If inference latency needs to be reduced, apply INT8 quantization:

**Post-Training Quantization (PTQ):**
```yaml
quantize:
  backend: "torchao"             # or "modelopt.pytorch"
  mode: "static_ptq"            # Requires calibration data
  algorithm: "minmax"           # or entropy, awq_clip, awq_lite
  device: "cuda"
```

**For TRT INT8 engine:**
```yaml
gen_trt_engine:
  tensorrt:
    data_type: INT8
    calibration:
      cal_image_dir: [/path/to/calibration/images]
      cal_cache_file: /path/to/cal.cache
      cal_batch_size: 8
      cal_batches: 100
```

**Accuracy check:** Always compare INT8 accuracy against FP16/FP32. Expect <1% accuracy loss. If larger:
- Try `entropy` calibration algorithm instead of `minmax`
- Increase calibration data (more images, more batches)
- Use per-layer precision control to keep sensitive layers in FP16

### Step 29 — Pruning (reduce model size)

If the model is too large for the target deployment:

```yaml
prune:
  mode: "amount"           # Prune by percentage
  amount: 0.3              # Remove 30% of channels
  granularity: 8           # 8-channel pruning granularity
  raw_prune_score: "L1"    # L1-norm based importance scoring
```

After pruning, **retrain** the pruned model to recover accuracy:
```bash
<model_name> train -e spec.yaml \
  train.resume_training_checkpoint_path=/path/to/pruned_model.pth \
  train.num_epochs=20   # Fewer epochs than initial training
```

### Step 30 — Knowledge Distillation (transfer knowledge)

If you have a larger, more accurate teacher model:

```yaml
distill:
  pretrained_teacher_model_path: /path/to/teacher.pth
  teacher:
    backbone:
      type: "<larger_backbone>"
  loss_type: "FD"          # Feature Distillation (smooth L1)
  loss_lambda: 0.5         # Balance between supervised and distillation loss
  mode: "auto"             # auto, logits, summary, or spatial
```

Distillation trains a smaller student model to match a larger teacher's behavior.

### Step 31 — Resolution & Input Size Tuning

For ViT-based models, changing input resolution can significantly affect accuracy/speed:

```yaml
dataset:
  img_size: 384            # Try larger resolution for better accuracy
                           # Or smaller resolution for faster inference
export:
  input_width: 384
  input_height: 384
```

**Note:** TAO automatically handles positional embedding interpolation for ViT models when the resolution changes from the pretrained size. The interpolation happens in `backbone_v2/vit.py` via bicubic interpolation.

### Optimization Decision Tree

```
Accuracy too low?
├── Check data pipeline (mean/std, augmentations, dataset format)
├── Check weight loading (missing keys, wrong mapping)
├── Try longer training / different LR schedule
├── Enable EMA
├── Try backbone freezing (small datasets)
└── Try knowledge distillation (if teacher available)

TRT accuracy worse than native?
├── Try FP32 engine first (isolate precision vs preprocessing issue)
├── Verify augmentation.mean/std match across all specs
├── Compare output tensors numerically on same input
└── Use per-layer FP16 for sensitive layers in INT8 engine

Inference too slow?
├── Use FP16 precision (default for most models)
├── Try INT8 quantization with calibration
├── Reduce input resolution
├── Prune model channels
├── Optimize batch size (larger = more throughput, up to GPU memory)
└── Profile with trtexec --verbose

Model too large?
├── Prune channels (amount=0.3-0.5)
├── Use INT8 quantization
├── Reduce input resolution
└── Distill to smaller backbone
```
