Full Phase 0 commands and content for the `tao-port-huggingface-model` skill — system prerequisite checks plus the one-time preparation of the published TAO Toolkit container images that the rest of the workflow runs inside. Linked from the SKILL.md Phase 0 summary.

## Phase 0 — Prerequisites Check

Use this reference only when the parent `SKILL.md` points here for the current task. If this file conflicts with current `SKILL.md`, `skill_info.yaml`, schemas, or platform/model skills, the current authoritative source wins.

## Contents

- Phase 0 — Prerequisites Check
  - Workflow-specific checks
  - GPU host runtime — delegate to tao-setup-nvidia-gpu-host
  - NGC registry login (TAO-Toolkit-specific)
  - Ask the user for the TAO Toolkit container images
  - Pull and prepare the TAO Toolkit images


Before starting any work, verify the system has all required infrastructure. **Hard stop if any check fails — resolve before proceeding.**

### Workflow-specific checks

```bash
# Python 3.10+
python3 --version

# git
git --version
```

### GPU host runtime — delegate to tao-setup-nvidia-gpu-host

The NVIDIA driver (branch 580), CUDA Toolkit 13.0, and NVIDIA Container
Toolkit 1.19.0 are owned by the `tao-skill-bank:tao-setup-nvidia-gpu-host` skill, not
by this workflow. Invoke its `--check-only` mode; on failure, ask the user to
authorize the install, then re-run.

```bash
TAO_SKILL_BANK_ROOT="${TAO_SKILL_BANK_PATH:-${TAO_SKILL_BANK_ROOT:-$PWD}}"
SETUP_SCRIPT="${TAO_SKILL_BANK_ROOT}/platform/tao-setup-nvidia-gpu-host/scripts/setup-nvidia-gpu-host.sh"

bash "$SETUP_SCRIPT" --backend docker --check-only || {
  echo "MISSING: TAO GPU host runtime not ready."
  echo "After user approval, run: bash \"$SETUP_SCRIPT\" --backend docker --install --yes"
  exit 1
}
```

This single delegation covers `nvidia-smi`, `nvcc`, the Docker daemon, the
NVIDIA Container Toolkit runtime registration, and the `docker run --gpus
all` smoke test. Do not re-implement those checks here — they live in
`tao-setup-nvidia-gpu-host` so every TAO skill picks up version pin changes the
moment that skill bumps.

### NGC registry login (TAO-Toolkit-specific)

```bash
# NGC Docker registry authentication (required to pull the TAO Toolkit container images from nvcr.io)
docker login nvcr.io
# Username: $oauthtoken
# Password: <NGC API Key>
# Verify: should print "Login Succeeded"
```

**NGC API Key:** required to pull the TAO Toolkit container images from `nvcr.io`. If the user does not have one, they must generate it at https://ngc.nvidia.com/setup/api-key. The login uses `$oauthtoken` as the username (literal string) and the NGC API key as the password.

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Python >= 3.10 installed
- [ ] `git` installed
- [ ] `tao-setup-nvidia-gpu-host --check-only` passes (driver 580, CUDA 13.0, NCT 1.19.0, `docker run --gpus all` smoke)
- [ ] NGC Docker registry authenticated (`docker login nvcr.io` succeeds)

If anything is missing, inform the user with the specific failure and what needs to be installed. Do NOT proceed until all checks pass.

### Ask the user for the TAO Toolkit container images

This skill drives modifications across `tao-core`, `tao-pytorch`, `tao-deploy`, and `tao-dataservices` and runs every test inside the matching TAO Toolkit container image on `nvcr.io`. Tags vary per release, so **the agent must ask the user for the exact image references** — the same way Phase 1 asks for repository paths and HF credentials. Ask up-front so they're available for every later phase.

Prompt the user with:

> Please provide the TAO Toolkit container image references you have access to on `nvcr.io` (or any registry mirror). Tags vary per release — paste the exact `<registry>/<repo>:<tag>` (or `@sha256:...`) string.
>
> 1. **tao-pytorch image** (required) — typically `nvcr.io/<org>/tao-toolkit:<version>-pyt` or `nvcr.io/<org>/tao-toolkit-pyt:<rc-tag>-multiarch`.
> 2. **tao-deploy image** (required) — typically `nvcr.io/<org>/tao-toolkit:<version>-deploy` or `nvcr.io/<org>/tao-toolkit-deploy:<rc-tag>-multiarch`.
> 3. **tao-dataservices image** (optional — only required if Phase 2.4 finds annotation-converter work) — typically `nvcr.io/<org>/tao-toolkit:<version>-data-services` or `nvcr.io/<org>/tao-toolkit-ds:<rc-tag>-multiarch`.
>
> tao-core does not require its own image — the public `nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:24.03-py3` image is used directly for tao-core smoke tests, or the prepared tao-pytorch image is reused.

Capture the answers into shell variables for the rest of Phase 0:

```bash
read -r -p "tao-pytorch image      : " TAO_PT_PUB_IMAGE
read -r -p "tao-deploy image       : " TAO_DEPLOY_PUB_IMAGE
read -r -p "tao-dataservices image : " TAO_DS_PUB_IMAGE   # leave blank to skip
```

If the user is non-interactive, accept the references as part of `$ARGUMENTS` or as environment variables exported beforehand.

### Pull and prepare the TAO Toolkit images

Each TAO Toolkit container image ships with the released TAO Python packages already installed (via wheels — see `tao-pytorch/release/docker/Dockerfile`, `tao-deploy/release/docker/Dockerfile.release`, and `tao-dataservices/release/docker/Dockerfile.release`). This skill installs the user's **local** clones of those packages on top via `pip install /workspace/...` + `python setup.py develop`, picking up all in-progress modifications. Pre-installed wheels would shadow the local source, so the preparation step removes them up front with `pip uninstall`. This leaves the CUDA + PyTorch + TensorRT + xformers + ONNX Runtime + OS layers fully intact, ready for the local source to be installed at run time.

The result is tagged with canonical local names that every later phase uses everywhere — `tao-pytorch-base:latest`, `tao-deploy-base:latest`, `tao-dataservices-base:latest` — so the per-release image references only ever appear here.

```bash
# Pull the TAO Toolkit container images
docker pull "$TAO_PT_PUB_IMAGE"
docker pull "$TAO_DEPLOY_PUB_IMAGE"
[ -n "$TAO_DS_PUB_IMAGE" ] && docker pull "$TAO_DS_PUB_IMAGE"

# Prepare the tao-pytorch image
#   Removes the pre-installed nvidia_tao_pytorch + nvidia_tao_core wheels (and their console_scripts).
docker build --build-arg PUB_IMAGE="$TAO_PT_PUB_IMAGE" -t tao-pytorch-base:latest - <<'EOF'
ARG PUB_IMAGE
FROM ${PUB_IMAGE}
# Remove pre-installed TAO packages so the local /workspace clones can be installed at run time.
RUN pip uninstall -y --quiet nvidia_tao_pytorch nvidia_tao_core 2>/dev/null || true
ENV PIP_DISABLE_PIP_VERSION_CHECK=1
EOF

# Prepare the tao-deploy image
docker build --build-arg PUB_IMAGE="$TAO_DEPLOY_PUB_IMAGE" -t tao-deploy-base:latest - <<'EOF'
ARG PUB_IMAGE
FROM ${PUB_IMAGE}
RUN pip uninstall -y --quiet nvidia_tao_deploy nvidia_tao_core 2>/dev/null || true
ENV PIP_DISABLE_PIP_VERSION_CHECK=1
EOF

# Prepare the tao-dataservices image (optional)
if [ -n "$TAO_DS_PUB_IMAGE" ]; then
  docker build --build-arg PUB_IMAGE="$TAO_DS_PUB_IMAGE" -t tao-dataservices-base:latest - <<'EOF'
ARG PUB_IMAGE
FROM ${PUB_IMAGE}
RUN pip uninstall -y --quiet nvidia_tao_ds nvidia_tao_pytorch nvidia_tao_core 2>/dev/null || true
ENV PIP_DISABLE_PIP_VERSION_CHECK=1
EOF
fi
```

**Notes on the preparation step:**

- `pip uninstall -y` removes both the package files **and** the registered `console_scripts` (`tao` CLI subcommands). When `python setup.py develop` runs against the local source in later phases, the entry points are re-registered cleanly.
- `nvidia_tao_core` is removed from every image because all three TAO Toolkit images install it; the local `pip install /workspace/tao-core` reinstalls the (potentially modified) version at run time.
- The dataservices image also pre-installs `nvidia_tao_pytorch`; we remove it too so a local-source override still wins.
- The `2>/dev/null || true` keeps the build idempotent — packages absent from a particular image variant don't fail the preparation.

**Verify the images work and the preparation succeeded:**

```bash
docker run --rm --gpus all tao-pytorch-base:latest nvidia-smi
docker run --rm --gpus all tao-deploy-base:latest nvidia-smi

# These should ALL print "not installed" — confirming the pre-installed packages were removed
docker run --rm tao-pytorch-base:latest \
  bash -c "pip show nvidia_tao_pytorch nvidia_tao_core 2>&1 | grep -E '(Name|not installed)'"
docker run --rm tao-deploy-base:latest \
  bash -c "pip show nvidia_tao_deploy nvidia_tao_core 2>&1 | grep -E '(Name|not installed)'"
```

If any `nvidia_tao_*` package still shows up in `pip show`, the preparation step missed something — re-check the image's `pip list` and add any missing `nvidia_tao_*` package to the corresponding `pip uninstall` line.

**Gate (Phase 0 done):**

- [ ] All system prerequisite checks pass.
- [ ] User provided TAO Toolkit image references for tao-pytorch, tao-deploy (and optionally tao-dataservices).
- [ ] `tao-pytorch-base:latest` and `tao-deploy-base:latest` exist locally and contain no pre-installed `nvidia_tao_*` packages.
- [ ] (Optional) `tao-dataservices-base:latest` exists locally if dataservices work is anticipated.

All subsequent phase reference files use the local tag names (`tao-pytorch-base:latest`, `tao-deploy-base:latest`, `tao-dataservices-base:latest`) — they don't need to know which underlying image fed them.
